# Zitrone: Green Box #
This is a map I made in 2009 to take some screenshots with a neutral background.

The common file format used is the .map format. The Valve Hammer Editor works better with its native .rmf format though, which is why you should follow these guidelines.

1. Open the .map file in Hammer
2. Save it as .rmf
3. Convert it to .map with [HLFix](http://extension.ws/hlfix/), NOT with Hammer

This way the file stays nice and clean.
